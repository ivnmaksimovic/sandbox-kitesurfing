#### Do I need a wet suite?

In the summer months the water is warm enough that no wet suite is necessary when kitesurfing.  But, due to the many hours of staying in water, in particular during the course, we recommend a 2-3 mm shortie or long wet suite depending on your blood circulation. 

#### Do I need warm clothes?

If you are coming in June or  Septembar and I would bring some trousers and a hoodie for the evening.

#### Should I reserve course/board/rentals before hand?

We recommend that you reserve a course or rental prior to arriving to guarantee you a spot as well as material.

#### Do you offer Storage?

Yes we do.

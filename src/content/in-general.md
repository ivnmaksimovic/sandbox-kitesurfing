##In general
Montenegro, the pearl of the Mediterranean, unique in many ways, is situated in the south of the Adriatic. Nowhere else can you find so much natural wealth, beauty, mild beaches, clear lakes, fast rivers, and gorgeous mountains in such a compact area as in Montenegro. In the morning you can wake up along the beautiful Adriatic coast, have lunch on the banks of Skadar Lake, and enjoy an evening walk in the Montenegrin mountains. Montenegro cannot leave you indifferent.

Ulcinj is the southernmost city at Montenegrin coast. Withits natural potential Ulcinj is tourism borne. The longest beach at the Adriatic sea – Velika plaza (Long Beach) 13 km long (Sandbox beach is part of the Long Beach), Ada Bojana – a unique river island with marvelous sandy beaches, Valdanos – a unique bay with a coastline coveredin old olive trees, the reconstructed old city of Ulcinj – full of interesting restaurants, cafés, galleries and hotels … and many other attractive sights make Ulcinj unique and attractive for many tourists. Velika plaza,with its geographic (sand beach 13 km long and 50-80 m wide) and climate (continuous mistral in period May – October reaching 15 – 25 knots) conditions is a perfect location for kitesurfing.

###The Spot
The main spot is ideal for beginners and intermediate kitesurfers due to its broad beach, waist deep water and the steady side-onshore wind. The Seafloor consists of fine sand without any rocks or reef. From May till September the Albanian Alps in the south cater for super steady thermal wind that will hit the coast in the early afternoon with 15 to 25 knots. In kite sizes this means usually 8 – 12sm at high season and bigger kites beginning at 12sm at off season. As tides don’t really exist in Montenegro you can start kiting whenever the wind kicks in. Due to the warm water, wetsuits are not really necessary in the summer. Some kilometres downwind there is a river mouth with perfect flat water. All the freestylers among you will find the perfect conditions over there to improve your skills. Of course, advanced kiters have the opportunity to leave their kite gear safely in the storage room. At the kitecenter you will find showers, toilets, sunbeds and other seating options where you can relax between the sessions and chat with other kitesurfers. After kiting you can enjoy a wonderful seafood restaurants on the river Bojana (2km from kitecentar), stroll through the old town or take a fun on a party in one of kitecentars. In the days when there is no wind we can organize exciting excursions for you: canyoning, rafting, kayaking, diving, sailing, hiking, bicycle tours ...

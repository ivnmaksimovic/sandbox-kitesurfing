During the winter season playing with kite don't stop. 
Snowkiting is a perfect winter choice for anyone who enjoys skiing, 
snowboarding, or kiteboarding. It is also the best way to learn and 
practice the techniques used in kiteboarding. 
Because you aren't fighting waves or trying to stand up on a board in the water, 
snowkiting is much easier to learn as well. You can ride on hills, 
lakes, mountains and plateaux for so long and far that your only  
companion will be the horizon.

### The Spot
The main spot is ideal for beginners and intermediate kitesurfers due to its broad beach, waist deep water and the steady side-onshore wind.
The Seafloor consists of fine sand without any rocks or reef.
From May till September the Albanian Alps in the south cater for super steady thermal wind that will hit the coast in the early afternoon with 15 to 25 knots.
In kite sizes this means usually 8 – 12sm at high season and bigger kites beginning at 12sm at off season.

As tides don’t really exist in Montenegro you can start kiting whenever the wind kicks in.

Due to the warm water, wetsuits are not really necessary in the summer.
Some kilometres downwind there is a river mouth with perfect flat water. All the freestylers among you will find the perfect conditions over there to improve your skills.
Of course, advanced kiters have the opportunity to leave their kite gear safely in the storage room.

At the kitecenter you will find showers, toilets, sunbeds and other seating options where you can relax between the sessions and chat with other kitesurfers.
After kiting  you can enjoy a wonderful seafood restaurants on the river Bojana (2km from kitecentar), stroll through the old town or take a fun on a party in one of kitecentars.

In the days when there is no wind we can organize exciting excursions for you: canyoning, rafting, kayaking, diving, sailing, hiking, bicycle tours...
